# What is the number of steps it will take to run Program 1 in the worst case? Express your answer in terms of n, the number of elements in the list L. You can assume list appending takes 1 step.
# 1+n+n*3n+1
# 1 : multiples = []
# n : execute an assignment of a value to x
# n*3n : n  : it will take n times to complete the for y inner loop.
         3n : 1n : execute an assginment of a value to y
              1n : x*y
              1n : list appending
# 1 : return multiples
