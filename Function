# module : a Python file that has something with a .py extension to it that's a collection of Python definitions of statements.
# Use circle module as an example

import circle
print (circle.pi)
# This means you are pulling out the value pi defined in circle module. If you find typing "circle + ." is troublesome, you can use another way to import

from circle import *
#This means you imported everything from circle and now you can simply type print(pi) to get the same result as above.

#file

file_object  = open("filename", "mode") 

"filename" could be a relative direction, or file type( could be filename.txt); 
"mode" is the way you want to open the file, 
ex: 
w : write mode ( new create or truncate the original one)
r : read mode ( can only read)
t : default mode (text)
